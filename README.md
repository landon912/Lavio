# README #

Lavio is a simple 2D C++ game engine that I created as an early learning project for C++ and OpenGL. Lavio includes a graphics abstraction layer that lays a foundation for using a graphics library of your choice. There is basic support for modern OpenGL built-in alongside two simple 2D rendering engines. 

### How do I get set up? ###

Lavio has two dependencies that are included in the repository:
* FreeType 2.7 [(LICENSE)](Libs/freetype-2.7/docs/LICENSE.TXT)

Lavio can be built using MSVC. There is an included Visual Studio project sln for Visual Studio 14. Any version after 10 should be able to open the project.
